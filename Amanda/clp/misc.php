        <h3>Exciting news!!</h3>
        <p>
          A.T. Haessly's third book in the Beginning of War series has been published - and the cover art is done by yours truly! This was definitely a challenge for me, but I learned so much during the process and I had so much fun shooting this and working closely with the author to brainstorm ideas and constantly sending "in-process" photos back and forth. If you'd like to know more about the process of creating this (or any of my work) I'd be more than happy to chat! You might even get to see the "before" photo and you might not believe this came out of the set up we had to rig together!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, so this cover makes you want to read the book?? (It's okay, the reason books have cover art is so you CAN judge what kind of story it is) Well I have just the link for you!

        <h3>St. Paul Cathedral</h3>
        <p>
          In 2015, my brother and his girlfriend brought me to St. Paul Cathedral while we were in Minnesota for the weekend. The first thing I heard when we entered those large doors was a small group of people chanting. I cannot describe the intense, deep, and lasting sense of peace that I felt listening to those prayers while taking in the grandeur of this place. For some reason which I will never understand, I did not have my camera that day. One year later I returned with my camera and finally got my chance. Although no photos could ever do this incredible place justice, I want to share some of the ones I captured. I highly recommend visiting this cathedral and taking a little time to think, pray, read, or do whatever it is that helps bring you peace. You'll find it here.

        <h3>Black and White Film</h3>
        <p>
          "Those who say that color will eventually replace black and white are talking nonsense. The two do not compete with each other. They are different means to different ends." - Edward Weston, 1953

          In addition to my beautiful clients, UWGB photo department has been keeping me busy with work in advanced black and white photography. The experiences I received this past year did not only mean creating many ideas (and filling a lot of sketchbook space) but shooting various projects, developing the negatives, and enlarging my prints. There is no better feeling as a photographer than watching my own piece of art come to life right in front of my eyes in the darkroom. Here are just a few samples, in no particular order, of the work I was most proud to bring to critique!

        <h3>The Beginning of War</h3>
        <p>by A.T. Haessly</p>
        <p>
          This novel, released August 2014, features my cover design and author photo.
          (It is listed as Amanda Haessly, rather than Amanda Lea Photography)
          I'm so blessed to have had this opportunity. The book is amazing and it was such a great experience working with the author
          to make his vision become a reality. Holding the very first copy in our hands was a
          dream come true!

          I don't think I should be the only one to enjoy our author photo shoot, so I included some bonus photos! The last one is a favorite of mine,

          now that's a portrait!
